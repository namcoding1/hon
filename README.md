# Tetris Game

This repository contains a simple terminal-based Tetris game implemented in Python using the `curses` library.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (with the built-in `curses` module)

## Running the Game

Execute the following command from the repository root:

```bash
python3 tetris.py
```

Use the arrow keys to move and rotate the pieces. Press `q` to quit.

The game board is drawn in the middle of your terminal with a visible border, so
it's clear where the sides and bottom are.
