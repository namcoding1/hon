# Tetris Game

This repository contains a simple terminal-based Tetris game implemented in Python using the `curses` library.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (with the built-in `curses` module)

## Running the Game

Execute the following command from the repository root:

```bash
python3 tetris.py
```

Use the left, right and down arrow keys to move the pieces. Press `s` to rotate them and `q` to quit.

The board now measures 12 columns by 24 rows and appears centered on your terminal. A colorful checkered background fills the rest of the window and a border clearly marks the play area.
